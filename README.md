# Regional Sales Summary - EDA Project

## Problem Statement

Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project aims to analyze and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.

## Business Questions

- **Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions**  
- **Lack of visibility into seasonal swings, top SKUs, and channel profitability**  
- **Goal:** Leverage 5 years of historical data to pinpoint growth levers and optimize strategy  

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   - Sales, customers, products, budget, and regional mapping.  
   - Cleaning, handling missing values, and merging relevant sheets.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Regional revenue and profit analysis.  
   - Seasonal swings (monthly/yearly trends).  
   - Top products (SKUs) by sales and profit.  
   - Channel profitability across regions.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and pie charts for insights.  
   - Comparison of actual vs. budgeted performance (2017).  

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identify high/low performing regions.  
   - Spot seasonal peaks and troughs.  
   - Highlight most profitable products/channels.  
   - Recommend strategic resource allocation.  

## Key Insights

- Regional performance shows **uneven revenue and profit distribution**.  
- Certain products (SKUs) contribute disproportionately to profits.  
- **Seasonality** strongly impacts monthly performance across regions.  
- Channel-level profitability varies, suggesting opportunities for optimization.  

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Data Visualization** libraries for charts and plots  

## Next Steps

- Build interactive dashboards for real-time regional sales tracking.  
- Incorporate forecasting models to predict future sales and profit trends.  
- Use insights to refine sales strategies and budget allocation.
